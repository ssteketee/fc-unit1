      <p>Dancer `x` is the independent variable and dancer `r_j(x)` is the reflected image, across mirror `j`, of `x`. Dancer `r_k(x)` is the reflected image across mirror `k` of `x`. Decide among yourselves how the fourth dancer should move. As you create and practice your dance, check to be sure the dancers are correctly positioned relative to the mirror.</p>
      <p>As you choreograph and practice your dance, take turns so everyone in the group has a chance to be the independent dancer. When you’re ready to perform your dance, ask someone from another group to video your group dance.</p>
			<p>✏️ As you created your dance, how did you decide the fourth dancer should move?</p>
			<p>✏️ In what direction must each of the other dancers move when `x` moves at 0°? at 90°? at 180°? at 270°?</p>

      <p>This page supports the Reflection Fixed Points lesson from the <a href="../">Introducing Geometric Transformations as Functions</a> unit. After investigating and experimenting with the fixed points of the reflect function, if you are given two points you will be able to construct the mirror that relates them, and if you are given a mirror and a single point you will be able to construct the other point. You will learn some important facts about distances between points, and you will be able to describe and explain the perpendicular bisector theorem and its converse.</p>
      <p>By the end of this lesson, you&rsquo;ll be able to perform these actions and answer these questions:</p>
