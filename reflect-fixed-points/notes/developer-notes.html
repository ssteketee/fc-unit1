Construct the Fixed Points
<p>These two sketches could ask students to trace the fixed points before constructing, thus checking their construction in advance of doing it.</p>
<p>One method would be to provide Tracing On/Off controls and a compass with traced center, and ask them to use it as in the previous activity. That would be the same compass as they actually use in the left-hand activity. Pro: this check would allow the user to actually attach the circle center to the constructed line, so that it makes a perfect trace.</p>
<p>Another approach would be a button that shows (and later hides) a second traced independent/dependent variable pair, along with the trace controls. They could then drag this independent variable to stay in superposition with its dependent variable, and then switch it off before constructing. Pros: by coming first, this check is pre-emptive, and by dragging an actual variable along the fixed-point locus it reinforces the meaning of a fixed point.</p>
<p>I've provided both, in a sense, in the right sketch. If you turn tracing on, another pair of variables will appear, both selectable and traced, so you can use them to trace out the fixed points. You can then hide them by turnign tracing off, and complete your construction. If you want, at the end, you can construct another circle, with its center on the line and its radius point on either A or B, to watch how it shows equal distances as you drag the center along the line.</p>
<p>How much of this is useful, and how much of it is over-thinking the activity?</p>
<p>If we keep `B` and `r_j(B)`, we should move it back to some canonical location when the user presses New Function, just in case they've dragged it off-screen.</p>
