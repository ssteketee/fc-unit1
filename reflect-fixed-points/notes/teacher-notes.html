Trace the Fixed Points
	<p>The purpose of this activity is to reinforce the connection students have made between the fixed points of the reflect function and the mirror, and also to begin to get them thinking about the mathematical connection between the locations of the fixed points (i.e., the points on the mirror) and the independent and dependent variables. This understanding, that a point on the mirror is equally distant from the pre-image and the image, will help students to discover that the mirror is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining the pre-image and image. The second sketch, in which students use the property of a circle (that every point on the circle is equally distant from the center), will help prepare students to use the compass as a tool to construct equal distances.</p>
