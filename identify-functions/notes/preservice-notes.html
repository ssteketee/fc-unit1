	<p>A similar activity to the Identify Functions task that you completed has been used with middle and high school students prior to a formal introduction to function. In this video clip you will see a class of high school students being introduced to the first page in the Identify Function task, in which they will be identifying independent and dependent variables. As you watch the video clip pay attention to the way in which the teacher launches the activity.</p>
	<p class="center">[Insert link to video clip here]</p>
	<p class="question">Q1. Reflect on how the technology itself was positioned in the launch of this task.&nbsp; Would you describe the technology tool as an amplifier or a reorganizer?&nbsp; Explain.</p>
	<p class="question">Q2. Jackson et al. (2013) identified 4 characteristics of an effective launch: 1) discuss the key contextual features of the task; 2) discuss the key mathematical ideas of the task; 3) develop common language to describe the key features; and 4) maintain the cognitive demand.&nbsp; Discuss the features of an effective launch that are evident in this brief clip of the Identify Functions launch. Provide evidence for your claims.</p>
	<p>In the next video clip, you will observe a pair of students from this class engaging with a few later pages in the Identifying Functions activity. Their written responses are shown below. As you watch the video clip, pay close attention to the actions the students&rsquo; take within the activity and how it relates to their mathematical understanding of what they observe.</p>

	<p class="question">Q3. Discuss the aspects of movement that the students&rsquo; attended to as they explored the mappings. How did these movements inform their understanding of the mappings? Provide specific examples. Are there any other aspects of movement you would recommend that the students&rsquo; attend to? If so, why?</p>
	<p class="question">Q4. What types of mathematical relationships did the students identify and discuss while they interacted with the variables on the page. Provide specific examples.</p>
	<p>You just watched one group of students working through a few pages of the identifying functions activity. One mapping in particular caught their attention, the mapping of <em>b</em> to <em>b</em>&rsquo; where <em>b&rsquo;</em> &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t move&rdquo;.&nbsp; Next observe two other groups of students engaging with this same mapping. As you watch the video clips pay close attention to the students&rsquo; thinking.</p>
	<p class="center">[insert two video links here]</p>
	<p class="question">Q5. For each video clip summarize what the group of students is thinking about with respect to the mapping (e.g., what do they understand and what are they struggling with).</p>
	<p class="question">Q7. For each video clip imagine you had just walked up to the group of students and observed them doing this work first hand. Note what questions you would ask these students and why.</p>
	<p class="question">Q6. If you were going to have the three groups discuss their ideas about this mapping with the class, in what order would you have them present? Why?</p>
	<p>Here are two definitions of function provided by high school students that have experienced function in only algebraic contexts.</p>
	<p class="question">Student 1: A function is when an input has a unique output.</p>
	<p class="question">Student 2: Vertical test - if goes through graph 2 times, not a function.</p>
	<p class="question">Q7. For each student consider what actions you might take to help the student refine the stated definition. Indicate how you might use specific pages within the Identify Function activity to support your discussion.</p>
