Get Started
    <p>As a class, looking at page 1, ask the class to describe what they observe about the behaviors of points, both those that can be dragged and those that cannot. PSMTs should classify the points as independent and dependent variables, and related pairs of points as functions. Encourage PSMTs to observe that the color and the notation are hints that make it easy to tell which variables are related. The notation also suggests which of each pair of variables is independent and which is dependent.</p>
	<p>As a class, looking at page 2, review briefly the notation used here: the variables are called a and f(a), and the function is called f. Try to elicit (or suggest, if necessary) the idea that f(a) is the output that results when input variable a has been acted on by function f. Though it’s not uncommon to see a function referred to as f(a), this is poor practice. It’s important for students to clearly distinguish the function f and the dependent variable f(a).</p>
	<p>Have the PSMT at the computer drag variable a, and ask PSMTs to describe the behavior of this function. It’s important not to use questioning techniques that lead PSMTs to particular answers. Instead, encourage PSMTs to paraphrase each other and to build on each other’s descriptions. As PSMTs describe various aspects of the function’s behavior, encourage them to pay attention to features that will be important when they describe the behavior of symbolic/numeric functions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the relative directions in which the variables move,</li>
		<li>the relative speeds with which they move, and</li>
		<li>the existence and location of any fixed points. (A fixed point is a location at which the independent and dependent variables coincide.)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Remind PSMTs that they observed these three characteristics (relative direction of motion, relative speed of motion, and fixed points) in the previous activity. Stress how important it is to observe these characteristics as they look for family resemblances in today’s activity. [Note: You might show page 12 here as it summarizes the goals.]</p>
	<p>After the directions are clear, have PSMTs work in pairs to complete the activity. As you circulate, look at PSMTs descriptions, note which ones will be useful in naming the different families during the class discussion. Observe PSMTs’ dragging strategies for figuring out which function is different, and encourage them to drag purposefully.</p>

Wrap Up
    <p>When PSMTs have had enough time to investigate and describe the similar and dissimilar behaviors on pages 1 through 11, call them together for a class discussion. You might begin by have individual volunteers come to the computer and demonstrate pages that they found most interesting on pages 1 through 8. Have them demonstrate, and describe in their own words, the similarities that they observed in three of the functions on that page. Then suggest that the class invent a name of the family being demonstrated. Next, ask if pages 9 - 11 (the picture pages) used any of the families that they just named and described. Ask PSMTs what other connections they saw between the pages with variables and the pages with pictures.</p>
	<p>To wrap up the discussion, ask PSMTs what strategies they used to find the function that was different. How much did it help to use the traces? What did they notice about how some traces differed from others? Is there any connection between the relative shapes of the traces and students’ observations about relative speed, relative direction, and fixed points of a function?</p>
