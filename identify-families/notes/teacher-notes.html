	<p>As students analyze the behavior of the four functions on each page, they will find it very helpful to compare the size and orientation of each pair of shapes. (Students may not be familiar with the term <em>asymmetrical</em>. There's no need to define the term at this time; it's sufficient to point out to students that some shapes reveal differences better than others. For instance, if they trace the letter <em>e</em> rather than the letter <em>o,</em> students will find it easier to detect differences in the two shapes.)</p>
	<p>Though Q3 asks specifically about shape, subsequent questions concentrate focus on behavior of variables. An important objective of this activity is that students connect the differences in the shapes to the relative movement of the variables. What is it about the behavior of the variables that results in the differences they observe in the traced shapes? Students should be able to explain differences in shape in terms of the rate of change (both speed and direction) of the variables.</p>
	<p>Looking for fixed points can also be very helpful, partly because function families differ in the number and arrangement of fixed points and partly because dragging through fixed points helps reveal important aspects of the behavior of the variables.</p>
