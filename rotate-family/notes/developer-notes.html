	<p>Current thinking is that this is a two-day lesson, with the first four activities on day 1 and the remaining activities on day 2. The Go Further activity is optional.</p>
	<p>After the HFWA field test I've moved away from the idea of students keeping everything in an online journal, for two reasons. (a) If each pair has only one computer, it's distracting and awkward to go back and forth between journal and sketch. (b) There's considerable value in students copying on paper the traces they've created on the screen. Just as dragging x around with the mouse is useful, so is the process of using a pencil on paper to show where they dragged x and where x' moved as a result.</p>
	<p>The current idea is to have a single-page worksheet for each day, with a significant amount of students' work to be recorded on the back (blank side) of the paper.</p>
	<p>The part 1 worksheet (activities 1 to 4) is linked from activity 1, and the part 2 worksheet is linked from activity 5. The teacher notes need to explain all this.</p>
	<p>The part 2 worksheet isn't done yet.</p>

Introduction
	<p>This is now three pages, each to be created using a different angle (180°, 90°, and 45°).</p>

Rotate Games
	<p>This is now five pages, with page 5 variables always in motion (and represented by the penguin and frog). Like the other games, more advanced levels become more abstract, so the penguin and star disappear at level 3.</p>

Trace a Star
	<p>This simple three-page sketch with no tools introduces the student to the techniques needed to construct stars. The videos also show two methods, one with the center of rotation at the center of the star and the other to show that there's a different way to do it, with the center of rotation midway between two of the points of the star.</p>
	<p>This sketch now uses the penguin and frog.</p>
	
Rotate Dances
	<p>This is now simpler, asking students to do a 180° dance and a 90° dance with a simple pattern (moving only radially and circularly) and two more dances using movements that are less intuitive for the dependent variable. The penguin and frog appear in a sketch with sample choreography for all four dances.</p>
	<p>It would be best to have an actual student video showing one of the sample dance patterns.</p>
	<h3>Virtual Dance Challenge</h3>
		<p>I reinserted this sketch, and added a video. Can we shorten the directions on the virtual dance?</p>
		<p>One improvement would be to add a "practice" video before the video of the game itself. The practice video would show a practice session of trying to move the cross-hairs around the polygon, without even having pressed the Ready Set Go button. This might support considerable shortening of the directions.</p>

Rotation Stars
	<p><a href="https://geometricfunctions.com/forge-math-connections/index.php?title=Activity:Rotate_Family#To_Do">See wiki to-do list.</a></p>
	<p> Consider removing pages 1 and 2 of websketch 5a.
	<p> (Daniel) Consider whether the Rotate tool should produce an animation button.</p>
	<p>Record a new Use Widgets video; the existing one is obsolete.</p>

Where, Oh Where, Can the Center Be?
	<p> On page 4 of Develop Your Methods, the penguin and the frog should autostart dancing.</p>
	<p>On page 4 of Develop Your Methods, the button should read “Animate p.”</p>
	<p> (Daniel) Consider making page 4 its own Go Further. I feel like it interrupts the flow because it isn’t the type of bite-size challenge found on the remaining pages of this websketch.</p>
	<p> Consider combining the Angle and Rotate tools in Solve the Mystery (6b) into just a single tool.</p>


Go Further
	<p> Make the text on each page larger.</p>
	<p> The Reflect tool does not work.</p>
	<p> Consider combining the Angle and Rotate tools into just a single tool.</p>


Check Yourself
	<p> (Daniel) Discuss moving these rotate family games so that they come right after Rotate Dances.</p>
	<p> Page 2 of the websketch should not autostart.</p>


To Do
<ul>
	<li>All activities: A number of help videos are either missing or in need of updating.</li>
	<li>All activities: Check the in-sketch directions. They should only supplement, not repeat, the web-page directions.</li>
</ul>
