	<p>Here's the new sequence of activities in this lesson</p>

		<li>Interlude (Teacup Ride)</li>
		<li>Rotate Games</li>

	</ol>
	<p>Current thinking is that this is a two-day lesson, with the first four activities on day 1 and the remaining activities on day 2. The Go Further activity is optional.</p>
	<p>After the HFWA field test I've moved away from the idea of students keeping everything in a journal, for two reasons. (a) If each pair has only one computer, it's distracting and awkward to go back and forth between journal and sketch. (b) There's considerable value in students copying on paper the traces they've created on the screen. Just as dragging x around with the mouse is useful, so is the process of using a pencil on paper to show where they dragged x and where x' moved as a result.</p>
	
Introduction
	<p>This is now four pages, each to be created using a different angle (180°, 90°, and 45°). Students </p>
	
	
Rotate Dances
		<p> Consider showing just the penguin at first in the Example.</p>
		<p>The ‘Example’ sketch should show the location of C and the value of theta on both pages. On page 2, students can change the location of C and the value of theta.</p>
		<p>Repurpose the current ‘Example’ sketch into a game that comes after the physical and virtual rotation dances. Start the game with pages 1 and 3 of Develop Your Methods. For the game itself, make it possible for the sketch to pick new locations of C and values of theta.</p> 
		<p>The Example sketch questions "Where's the center? What's the angle?" could be made into a game in which you drag a point D to where you think the center is, and set a slider to what you think the angle is, and then press "Check my answer" to see the dance prescribed by your guesses. This would allow you to refine your guess, perhaps even while the dancers  are dancing.</p>
	<h3>Example</h3>
		<p>The teacher-note suggestion to use the animation to suggest to students what they'll be doing should be replaced by a video of actual students doing a rotate dance.</p>
	<h3>Do the Rotate Dance</h3>
	<h3>Virtual Dance Challenge</h3>
		<p>Fix long directions on the virtual dance.</p>

Rotation Stars
	<p><a href="https://geometricfunctions.com/forge-math-connections/index.php?title=Activity:Rotate_Family#To_Do">See wiki to-do list.</a></p>
	<p> Consider removing pages 1 and 2 of websketch 5a.
	<p> (Daniel) Consider whether the Rotate tool should produce an animation button.</p>
	<p>Record a new Use Widgets video; the existing one is obsolete.</p>

Where, Oh Where, Can the Center Be?
	<p> On page 4 of Develop Your Methods, the penguin and the frog should autostart dancing.</p>
	<p>On page 4 of Develop Your Methods, the button should read “Animate p.”</p> 
	<p> (Daniel) Consider making page 4 its own Go Further. I feel like it interrupts the flow because it isn’t the type of bite-size challenge found on the remaining pages of this websketch.</p>
	<p> Consider combining the Angle and Rotate tools in Solve the Mystery (6b) into just a single tool.</p>


Go Further
	<p> Make the text on each page larger.</p>
	<p> The Reflect tool does not work.</p>
	<p> Consider combining the Angle and Rotate tools into just a single tool.</p>


Check Yourself
	<p> (Daniel) Discuss moving these rotate family games so that they come right after Rotate Dances.</p>
	<p> Page 2 of the websketch should not autostart.</p>


To Do
<ul>
	<li>All activities: A number of help videos are either missing or in need of updating.</li>
	<li>All activities: Check the in-sketch directions. They should only supplement, not repeat, the web-page directions.</li>
</ul>
