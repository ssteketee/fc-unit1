Get Started
	<h4>Prepare ahead of time</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="highlight">Make the Lesson Journal available to students.</span> They can download a copy to their computer using the Ⓙ icon in the lesson's title bar, or you can download it yourself, customize it, and make it available to students in a way that's convenient to you.</li>
		<li>Ideally students use the Lesson Journal interactively, so they can type their answers and expand the amount of space to fit those answers.</li>
		<li>Prepare the Rotate Dance activity by printing large protractors and preparing lengths of string for measuring distances.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Launch the lesson</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="highlight">Display the lesson webpage</span> so students can see both the Warm-Up activity and the webpage url when they enter the room.</li>
		<li>As students begin to arrive, <span class="highlight">ask an early arrival</span> to experiment with the Warm-Up using either the interactive whiteboard or a wireless mouse. Tell the student to get no more than one ball into the basket (not giving away too much to later arrivals) and then to go to their own computer to complete the Warm-Up.</li>
		<li>To involve more students, you could call up another student, have them refresh the page, and then ask them to help a different player score a basket.</li>
		<li><span class="highlight">Organize students into pairs</span> as they arrive, using a system of your choice. You might, for instance, designate each pair of desks for a particular number and color (red or black), so that the two students who draw red 4 cards sit together at a designated pair of desks.</li>
		<li>Let students know that they should <span class="highlight">do the Warm-Up activity individually,</span> without waiting for their partner to arrive, but for the rest of the lesson they'll use a single computer per pair, and they'll complete and turn in a single Lesson Journal for their team.</li>
	</ul>

Warm-up
	<h4>While Students Work</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>While students are working on the Warm-Up, <span class="highlight">circulate</span> to encourage <span class="highlight">students having difficulty</span> and to notice what students might have insights worth sharing with the class.</li>
		<li>As you circulate, ask individual students what this activity <span class="highlight">has to do with functions.</span> What are the independent variables? What are the dependent variables? What do they notice about the rules that relate the variables?</li>
		<li><span class="highlight">Identify students</span> who've noticed particular characteristics of one function or another. For instance, a student may have noticed that one basketball moves in the exact opposite direction from its player, and another may have noticed that there's a particular spot on the court where a player and her basketball come together.</li>
		<li>Once most students have two or more basketballs in the basket, <span class="highlight">call the class to attention,</span> and have them close laptop lids or turn tablets upside down.</li>
		<li>Let students who haven't finished know that they can <span class="highlight">come back to this activity</span> when they have spare time later during the class.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Brief Discussion</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Remind students that the <span class="highlight">pencil icon</span> means they're to write down, in their Lesson Journal, their answers to the question that appear on-screen. Also remind them that the Lesson Journal may contain some <span class="highlight">additional prompts</span> for them to think about and respond to.</li>
		<li>If a student has noted a place where a particular <span class="highlight">player and her basketball come together,</span> ask the student to <span class="highlight">demonstrate</span> this, and ask whether finding such a place helped at all to put the ball in the basket. Ask students if they remember what such places are called (<span class="highlight"><em>fixed points</em></span>).</li>
		<li>If a student has noted a particular relationship between a player's <span class="highlight">direction of motion</span> and the direction of motion of her ball, ask the student to demonstrate, and ask whether finding such a relationship helped at all to put the ball in the basket. Ask students if they remember what relationships like this are called (<span class="highlight"><em>relative rate of change</em></span>).</li>
		<li>Give students a chance to describe things they <span class="highlight">noticed</span> that they found interesting, or to describe something that they <span class="highlight">wondered</span> as they were doing the activity.</li>
		<li>Here are a few things students may have noticed or wondered:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>With which player was it easiest to score? Why?</li>
			<li>Do a player and her ball ever come together in one place? If so, how can you find that place?</li>
			<li>If you drag a player in a straight line, what sort of path does her ball follow?</li>
			<li>When you got the ball close to the basket, how did you decide which way to move the mouse?</li>
			<li>Which function made it easiest to score? Which made it hardest?</li>
			<li>How can you tell the independent variable from the dependent variable?</li>
			<li>What do you notice about the relative motion of the two variables?</li>
			<li>Did these functions have any fixed points? If so, were they useful in finding a solution?</li>
			<li>Compare two players (for instance, `x` and `y`) to figure out what's similar and what's different about the relative movement of the player and her ball.</li>
			<li>What is different about each of these four functions? What similar features (family resemblances) can you identify?</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<p>Tell students that they'll begin this activity by <span class="highlight">constructing their own Rotate functions.</span></p>

Introduction
	<h4>Launch this Activity</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Remind student they are to <span class="highlight">work in pairs,</span> and to <span class="highlight">take turns</span> as operator and coach. The <span class="highlight">operator</span> is responsible for the constructing and manipulating objects in the sketch, and the <span class="highlight">coach</span> is responsible for making suggestions and for recording the team's results in the Lesson Journal.</li>
		<li>Some students may want always to be the operator, so you may need to stress the importance of being <span class="highlight">a good team-mate</span> and of making sure that both partners have plenty of opportunity to construct and manipulate.</li>
		<li>If all students have their own computers, it may be convenient for each pair to use one student's computer to interact with the lesson and the other to write up their Lesson Journal.</li>
		<li>Have a coach <span class="highlight">read the first direction.</span> If some students haven't completely mastered watching for glowing objects when they use construction tools, <span class="highlight">show the <em>Use the tools</em> hint video</span> and point out to students how the glowing objects are being matched when using the Rotate tool: `x` to `x`, `C` to `C`, and `theta` to `theta`. (You may want to point out that the video shows that `theta` is matched to `theta` by <span class="highlight">dragging the `theta` label</span> rather than dragging the number.</li>
		<li>Remind students that the pencil icons indicate question or directions that call for them to make entries in their Lesson Journal.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Explore</h4>
	<p>Displaying a <span class="highlight">countdown timer</span> (approximately 8 or 10 minutes) may help to keep students on track.</p>
	<p>As you circulate, note particular <span class="highlight">issues</span>, and <span class="highlight">students</span> on whom you’ll want to call during discussion.</p>
	<p>Take particular note of students who change the angle slider, or who move the center point, while tracing is still on. Ask them what the blue traces can possibly mean when `x` is not moving: how can the dependent variable possibly move if the independent variable is stationary? (Raising this question with them is sufficient; don't address answering it until the discussion of this activity.</p>
	<p>Page 3 of the sketch is an extra page for students who might like to experiment with an additional rotate function or perhaps with some other question that interests them.</p>
	<h4>Discuss</h4>
	<p>Ask several students to identify one thing they noticed, or one thing they wondered, as they constructed their functions.</p>
	<p>Have a student demonstrate something they did that caused the dependent variable to leave a blue trace when the independent variable was not moving. Ask students, "How this can possibly happen? If it's really a dependent variable, it shouldn't move unless the independent variable moves!" With appropriate follow-up questions, help students come to their own realization that by changing 	`theta`	or `C` they are changing the function rule, which changes the relationship between `x` and `R_(C,theta)(x)`, so of course the dependent variable needs to be in a different location, because the rule connecting the two variables has changed.</p>
	<p>Here are some possible questions or observations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What <span class="highlight">part of the function</span> does each tool create?</li>
		<li>What makes one function <span class="highlight">different</span> from another?</li>
		<li>Why do we say all the functions you created belong to <span class="highlight">one family?</span></li>
		<li>What do the two functions you constructed have in common? What distinguishes then from each other?</li>
		<li>Did anyone create a particularly interesting or unusual function?</li>
	</ul>

Rotate Dances
<h3>Example</h3>
	<p>This section is optional. Even if you don’t use it, you may want to show the page 1 animation briefly to suggest what a rotate dance involves.</p>
	<p>Page 2 of the Example sketch challenges students to find the center and rotation angle. This can encourage them to review </p>
<h3>Do the Rotate Dance</h3>
	<p>As you divide the class into groups, make sure that every group has at least four students: enough for two dancers (the independent and dependent variables) and two choreographers. One of the choreographers can also shoot the video.</p>
	<p>Tell students that they need to turn in their best dance video at the end of the activity, and that your two criteria for the dances is that they pay attention to precision (being in the right place) and that they show that performing a function can be fun.</p>
	<p>Once you’ve launched the activity, play some dance music (either your own or from a student) to help set the tone.</p>
	<p>Students may be unclear how to use the clothesline to check the location of the dependent variable. It can be useful to guide one group through this check.(Other nearby groups are likely to observe.) The directions in the activity are not very detailed; here's a more detailed explanation, in which A and B represent two choreographers:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>A holds one end of the rope on the floor at the exact center of the protractor on the floor.</li>
		<li>B arranges the rest of the rope to stretch it taut along the floor from `C`	to `x`.
		<li>A notes the angle the rope makes on the protractor, and B notes the distance by holding the rope right in front of `x`.</li>
		<li>A adds `theta` to the angle of the rope (subtracting 360° if necessary).</li>
		<li>B holds the rope at the point where it's just in front of `x` and then rotates it so it remains taut, and is at the new angle calculated by A.</li>
		<li>`R(x)` readjusts her position so that she is at a spot directly beyone the place where B is holding the rope.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Consider telling students to warm up by doing two dances (90° and 180°) with simple domains, and switching the roles of dancer and choreographer from one to the other.</p>
	<p>Students will incorporate various arm and body movements as they practice and perform their dances. This is all part of the fun, but they still need to concentrate on getting the distance and angle right.</p>
	<p>After these warm-up dances, they're on their own to perform (and video) a dance that's both precise and fun.</p>
<h3>Virtual Dance Challenge</h3>
	<p></p>

Rotation Stars
<h3>Overview and Page 1</h3>
	<p>The patterns on pages 1 through 5 challenge students to think creatively about how to construct designs with rotation symmetry, and at the same time require them to figure out the angle they need to use for symmetries that can be of order 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12.
	</p>
	<p>Give student pairs a few minutes to work on page 1. Most students will make the second arm of the star with a 90° rotation using the first arm (the orange segment) as the domain and the top left endpoint as the center. As you circulate look for pairs who used different methods for creating the next arm. You’ll probably observe three different methods:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Some pairs will use the original `x`, changing their angle slider to 180°.</li>
		<li>Some pairs will use the original `x`, but construct a new 180° angle slider.</li>
		<li>Some pairs will use `R_(C,theta)(x)` as the independent variable, rotating it again using the 90° slider.</li>
	</ol>
<h3>Brief Discussion</h3>
	<p>When most pairs have constructed the 180° arm of the star, call the class to order and have a student read aloud the directions for pages 2 through 5. Those directions call for students to try out different methods—but the directions don’t define “different” in this context. This situation presents a nice opportunity for at least three different students (whom you identified while circulating) to describe how they made the 180° arm of the star. This discussion represents an opportunity to explore multiple solutions, to discuss the question of how different the described methods are from each other, and to introduce the concept of function composition (though without naming it at this time). Possible student observations and argumentation include:
	<ul>
		<li>“Method 1 uses just one function.”</li>
		<li>“No, it’s really two functions because they changed the angle. Rotating by 180° is different from rotating by 90°.”</li>
		<li>"Method 1 is easier because...” or “Method 2 is better because...” or “I like Method 3 because...”</li>
		<li>“Method 3 is the only one that uses just one function, rotating by 90°.”</li>
		<li>“No, Method 3 changes the independent variable every time they use it.”</li>
		<li>“But changing the independent variable doesn't change the function. It’s still the same rule, so that makes it the same function.”</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Aim for a productive discussion, involving as many students as possible and giving them an opportunity to clarify their ideas (and their language) about what a function is and what makes one function different from another. By the end of the discussion, the class needs to agree on how to categorize the methods they’ll use on pages 2 through 5. For each page, students are asked to draw in their journal the design they made and to list the angles they used and how many times they used each angle. </p>
<h3>Pages 2 through 7</h3>
<p>Encourage students to continue to look for different and creative approaches as they construct star designs on pages 2 through 5. Pages 6 and 7 provide students who finish early with a chance to get really creative with their designs.</p>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
	<p>As you lead the class discussion of the Rotation Stars task, consider several priorities:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Emphasize the variety of strategies that can be used to construct figures with rotation symnmetry.</li>
		<li>Encourage the use of mathematical language, particularly &ldquo;variable,&rdquo; &ldquo;independent,&rdquo;, &ldquo;dependent,&rdquo; &ldquo;restricted domain,&rdquo; &ldquo;range,&rdquo; and &ldquo;rotation symmetry.&rdquo; Point out how language enables us to commnunicate with clarity and precision.</li>
		<li>By the time they finish, most students will have made signficant use of Method 3 above, so this may be an appropriate time to introduce the term “function composition.” Some students may even have composed a function with itself as many as 11 times (for a design with 12-fold rotation symmetry), and they might like to know that they have been using something called an “iterated function system.”</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The original author of this activity thanks his young assistant Sebastian for helping him to imagine and implement this activity.</p>


Where, Oh Where, Can the Center Be?
	<h3>Develop Your Methods</h3>
	<p>This activity is designed to emphasize some of the fundamental characteristics of the rotate function, and prepare students to actually construct the center of rotation, given a geometric shape and its rotated image.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>P1: The two variables are equally distant from the center of rotation.</li>
		<li>P2: The two variables lie on a circle with its center at the center of rotation.</li>
		<li>P3-4: The center of rotation is the fixed point of the function.</li>
		<li>P5: Given two undraggable variables, there are multiple possible locations for the center.</li>
		<li>P6-7: You can use either distance measurements or a circle to guide you in tracing the possible locations for the center. In either case, one objective is that students notice that the locus is the set of points equally distant from `x` and `R_(C,theta)(x)`.</li>
		<li>P8: With the supplemental artifacts (two linked circles and a line) students can locate the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining `x` and `R_(C,theta)(x)`, and check their result  </li>
	</ul>
	<p>Pages 1 through 5 are in the form of games, with built-in scoring. You can ask students to record their scores in their journals, to monitor themselves by making sure they score 90 out of ten tries on each page before going on to the next page, or even to set their own criteria for advancing from one page to the next. M</p>
	<h3>Solve the Mystery</h3>
	<p></p>

Check Yourself
	<p>You may want to ask students to submit, by email or otherwise, a screen capture of their best effort at each of the challenges. Point out to students that earlier levels can be done precisely and later levels require students to develop estimating skills, you might ask them to submit two screen captures, one at a level of precision aiming for 10 correct results out of 10 tries and one at a level of estimation aiming for 7 </p>
