			<div class="fcSubsectionBody">
				<div class="jaxContainer twoColumn">
					<h4>First Dance</h4>
					<p>Use a group of three or four students to perform a 180° rotate dance: an independent dancer, a dependent dancer, and one or two choreographers. You will do at least four dances, so each group member should take a turn playing each role.</p>
					<p>You can include specific arm, leg, and other body motions in your dance. The choreographer(s) should make sure the dependent dancer's motion is a rotation. (For instance, if the independent dancer raises her right arm, the choreographer(s) should check that the dependent dancer also raises her right arm (<em>not</em> her left arm).</p>
					<p>For your first dance, follow the steps below.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Choose one person as the independent dancer and another as the dependent dancer.</li>
						<li>Mark a center point on the floor.</li>
						<li>The two dancers face each other, close to the center point.</li>
						<li>The independent dancer moves in a similar pattern to the penguin in the sketch below, backing away from the center, moving around the center, and finally approaching the center.</li>
						<li>The dependent dancer moves at the same speed in the opposite direction.</li>
						<li>The choreographer(s) make sure the dependent dancer keeps the center half-way between the two dancers (as in the dance below).</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>More Dances</h4>
					<p>Change roles and do a 90° rotate dance, similar to the 90° dance the penguin and frog do below.</p>
					<p>Do two more dances (first 180° and then 270°), changing roles each time. For these dances use a more challenging pattern. Page 2 of the sketch shows an example.</p>

					<p>Up until now, you’ve mostly been the independent variable: you were either free to move around the plane, or you had to move around a polygon or other restricted domain. But in this challenge, you have to help the frog, who's the dependent variable. The penguin will move around a polygon, and your challenge is to help the frog follow the function rule.</p>
					<p>On page 1 you have to drag the frog so you’re always the 180° rotation of the penguin as she moves around the polygon. Fortunately you have a 180° arc and cross-hairs to help you. As long as you can keep the penguin in the cross-hairs, you are in the correct location, so you just have to get the penguin in the cross-hairs and keep her there once she starts moving.</p>
					<p>Before you start the game, practice moving the frog so the cross-hairs move around the border of the polygon, because that's the path that the penguin will dance.</p>
					<p>When you think you’re ready to play, move the frog so the cross-hairs are over the penguin. Then press the Countdown button and get ready to move the frog. When the countdown ends and the penguin starts moving, and you have to move the frog to always be the 180° rotation of the penguin.</p>
					<p>Page 2 has another challenge using a different polygon, center, and angle of rotation.</p>
					<p>On page 3, you can adjust `C`, `θ`, and the vertices of the polygon and then hide them all to make an interesting challenge for a classmate.</p>
					<p>Which is easier: being the independent variable or the dependent variable? Explain your thinking.</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="pencil">What you notice, and wonder, as you practiced the dance on page 1?</li>
						<li class="pencil">Did you get better as you practiced? Could you do the dance at a more difficult level and still keep the colors green?</li>
						<li class="pencil">Are the dances on pages 2 and 3 easier (because of your practice on page 1) or harder? Explain.</li>
						<li class="pencil">Having done physical dances and virtual dances, is it easier being the independent variable or the dependent variable? Why?</li>

				<div class="jaxContainer twoColumn">
					<p>In the drawing below, this student shows that he used two different function rules. In the first line he writes `R_1: C_1, 60°` to say that rotation `R_1` rotates about center `C_1` by `60°`, and then he writes `x_1=R_1(x)` to say that dependent variable `x_1` was constructed by applying function rule `R_1` to independent variable `x`. Similarly, he writes another line to describe his function `R_2`, with a different center point and angle, which he used to construct dependent variable `x_2`.</p>
					<img src="./video/describe-star1.png">
					<p>In this second drawing, another student shows that she used a single function rule two times. In the first line she writes `R_1: C, 120°` to say that rotation `R_1` rotates about center `C` by `120°`, and then she writes `x_1=R_1(x)` to say that dependent variable `x_1` was constructed by applying function rule `R_1` to independent variable `x`. On her second line she uses the same function again, so she just writes `x_2=R_1(x_1)` to say that dependent variable `x_2` was constructed by applying function rule `R_1` to variable `x_1`.</p>

      <p>This page supports the Rotate Family lesson from the <a href="../">Introducing Geometric Transformations as Functions</a> unit. You will construct rotation functions, manipulate and observe them, and learn how this function family behaves.</p>
      <p>By the end of this lesson, you&rsquo;ll be able to perform these actions and answer these questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Vary the independent variable.</em> Vary the independent variable `x` by dragging it freely, and later by dragging it along a restricted domain.</li>
				<li><em>Construct the dependent variable.</em> Given an independent variable `x`, a center `C`, and an angle `theta`, construct the dependent variable.</li>
				<li><em>Restrict the domain.</em> Construct an independent variable on a restricted domain to limit where it can move.</li>
				<li><em>Where’s the center?</em> Find the center point given an independent variable `x` and its rotated image`R_(C,θ)(x)`.</li>
				<li><em>What’s the angle?</em> Determine the angle of rotation given an independent variable and its rotated image.</li>
				<li><em>What’s the function?</em> Construct the rotate function given an independent variable and its rotated image.</li>
				<li><em>What’s the function?</em> Construct the rotate function given a restricted domain and the corresponding range.</li>
				<li><em>Use mathematical language.</em> Use mathematical terms and function notation to describe an independent variable and its rotated image. Use both independent/dependent “variable” terminology and “preimage/image” terminology. </li>
				<li><em>How do they move?</em> Describe the relative motion (rate of change) of the variables for a given rotate function `R_(C,θ)`.</li>
				<li><em>Draw the range.</em> Given a rotate function (defined by its center point and angle of rotation) and a restricted domain, draw the shape of the range.</li>
				<li><em>Do the rotate dance.</em> Given a rotate function and an independent variable animated on a restricted domain, vary the dependent variable accordingly.</li>
				<li><em>Construct a rotation star.</em> Given a center point and positive integer n, create design with n-fold rotation symmetry.</li>
				<li><em>Compose rotate functions.</em> Apply one rotate function to the dependent variable of another. Consider special cases: a function is composed with itself, and a function is composed with another (the inverse) so that the composite is the identity function.</li>
				<li><em>Construct the range.</em> Given a rotate function RC,θ that operates on a point, construct the range given a polygon domain.</li>
				<li><em>How is rotation different?</em> Describe several differences between rotate functions and reflect functions.</li>
				<li><em>Score!</em> Use your understanding of the rotate function to put the balls in the net quickly and easily.</li>
