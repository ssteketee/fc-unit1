			<p>This lesson is under construction, and neither its activities nor its teacher notes are final.</p>
			<p>Changes from earlier work include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>This lesson consists of a series of activities in which students investigate, explore, and create the mathematics they are learning.</li>
				<li>The Warm-Up activity is already displayed, to engage students right away.</li>
				<li>Each subsequent activity can be shown or hidden by tapping its title bar.</li>
				<li>The Check Yourself activity is an opportunity for students to assess their own understanding.</li>
				<li>Most activities include short silent “hint videos” that provide useful hints, reducing students’ need for explicit worksheet instructions.</li>
				<li>For multi-page sketches, there's now a page controller to make it easy to switch pages.</li>
				<li>When appropriate, sketch pages include widgets that students can use to change the style or visibility of objects in the sketch.</li>
				<li>Students should be asked to keep a journal of their work on the entire lesson.</li>
				<li>A journal template contains questions for students to answer and other prompts for them to respond to and write about.</li>
				<li>A pencil icon ✏️ on the web page indicates a question that students should address in their journal.</li>
				<li>The standard journal template can be downloaded by pressing the Ⓙ button in the lesson title bar, or can be customized by the teacher.</li>
				<li>Worksheets are few in number, replaced by multiple other supports:</li>
				<ul style="margin-left: 2rem;">
					<li>Short general directions on the web page.</li>
					<li>Per-page directions in the sketch.</li>
					<li>Hint videos.</li>
					<li>The prompts and questions in the journal template.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Teacher notes are available by adding "?user=teacher" at the end of the url in the browser's address bar. Teacher notes aim to cover basic information and suggestions most important for using the lesson successfully. More in-depth background and commentary is available in the PD/Preservice notes.</li>
				<li>To access the teacher notes for any activity, press the Ⓣ button in the activity title bar. To access pd/preservice notes, press the Ⓟ button.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>What's not finished as of 2/12/18:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The lesson journal template is only partially complete.</li>
				<li>Some hint videos are missing, and some need to be redone due to edits in activities.</li>
				<li>Some in-sketch directions are not yet coordinated with the corresponding web-page text.</li>
				<li>The teacher notes and the pd/preservice notes are not yet complete.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Feel free to use this lesson in its current form, recognizing that some elements remain incomplete. As we continue refining this lesson, <a href="mailto:webmaster@geometricfunctions.org?subject=Rotate%20Family%20Activity">we solicit your feedback and suggestions to make it better</a>.</p>

					<p>Up until now, you’ve mostly been the independent variable: you were either free to move around the plane, or you had to move around a polygon or other restricted domain. But in this challenge, you have to help the frog, who's the dependent variable. The penguin will move around a polygon, and your challenge is to help the frog follow the function rule.</p>
					<p>On page 1 you have to drag the frog so you’re always the 180° rotation of the penguin as she moves around the polygon. Fortunately you have a 180° arc and cross-hairs to help you. As long as you can keep the penguin in the cross-hairs, you are in the correct location, so you just have to get the penguin in the cross-hairs and keep her there once she starts moving.</p>
					<p>Before you start the game, practice moving the frog so the cross-hairs move around the border of the polygon, because that's the path that the penguin will dance.</p>
					<p>When you think you’re ready to play, move the frog so the cross-hairs are over the penguin. Then press the Countdown button and get ready to move the frog. When the countdown ends and the penguin starts moving, and you have to move the frog to always be the 180° rotation of the penguin.</p>
					<p>Page 2 has another challenge using a different polygon, center, and angle of rotation.</p>
					<p>On page 3, you can adjust `C`, `θ`, and the vertices of the polygon and then hide them all to make an interesting challenge for a classmate.</p>
					<p>Which is easier: being the independent variable or the dependent variable? Explain your thinking.</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="pencil">What you notice, and wonder, as you practiced the dance on page 1?</li>
						<li class="pencil">Did you get better as you practiced? Could you do the dance at a more difficult level and still keep the colors green?</li>
						<li class="pencil">Are the dances on pages 2 and 3 easier (because of your practice on page 1) or harder? Explain.</li>

					<p>In the drawing below, this student shows that he used two different function rules. In the first line he writes `R_1: C_1, 60°` to say that rotation `R_1` rotates about center `C_1` by `60°`, and then he writes `x_1=R_1(x)` to say that dependent variable `x_1` was constructed by applying function rule `R_1` to independent variable `x`. Similarly, he writes another line to describe his function `R_2`, with a different center point and angle, which he used to construct dependent variable `x_2`.</p>

In the first line she writes `R_1: C, 120°` to say that rotation `R_1` rotates about center `C` by `120°`, and then she writes `x_1=R_1(x)` to say that dependent variable `x_1` was constructed by applying function rule `R_1` to independent variable `x`.

      <p>This page supports the Rotate Family lesson from the <a href="../">Introducing Geometric Transformations as Functions</a> unit. You will construct rotation functions, manipulate and observe them, and learn how this function family behaves.</p>
      <p>By the end of this lesson, you&rsquo;ll be able to perform these actions and answer these questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Vary the independent variable.</em> Vary the independent variable `x` by dragging it freely, and later by dragging it along a restricted domain.</li>
				<li><em>Construct the dependent variable.</em> Given an independent variable `x`, a center `C`, and an angle `theta`, construct the dependent variable.</li>
				<li><em>Restrict the domain.</em> Construct an independent variable on a restricted domain to limit where it can move.</li>
				<li><em>Where’s the center?</em> Find the center point given an independent variable `x` and its rotated image`R_(C,θ)(x)`.</li>
				<li><em>What’s the angle?</em> Determine the angle of rotation given an independent variable and its rotated image.</li>
				<li><em>What’s the function?</em> Construct the rotate function given an independent variable and its rotated image.</li>
				<li><em>What’s the function?</em> Construct the rotate function given a restricted domain and the corresponding range.</li>
				<li><em>Use mathematical language.</em> Use mathematical terms and function notation to describe an independent variable and its rotated image. Use both independent/dependent “variable” terminology and “preimage/image” terminology. </li>
				<li><em>How do they move?</em> Describe the relative motion (rate of change) of the variables for a given rotate function `R_(C,θ)`.</li>
				<li><em>Draw the range.</em> Given a rotate function (defined by its center point and angle of rotation) and a restricted domain, draw the shape of the range.</li>
				<li><em>Do the rotate dance.</em> Given a rotate function and an independent variable animated on a restricted domain, vary the dependent variable accordingly.</li>
				<li><em>Construct a rotation star.</em> Given a center point and positive integer n, create design with n-fold rotation symmetry.</li>
				<li><em>Compose rotate functions.</em> Apply one rotate function to the dependent variable of another. Consider special cases: a function is composed with itself, and a function is composed with another (the inverse) so that the composite is the identity function.</li>
				<li><em>Construct the range.</em> Given a rotate function RC,θ that operates on a point, construct the range given a polygon domain.</li>
				<li><em>How is rotation different?</em> Describe several differences between rotate functions and reflect functions.</li>
				<li><em>Score!</em> Use your understanding of the rotate function to put the balls in the net quickly and easily.</li>
