	<p><b>Reflect Dance.</b> Think about your experience doing the reflect dances.</p>
	<p class="question">Q1.What do you anticipate high school students might do when posed the same challenges? Explain.</p>

	<p class="question">Q2. To which aspects of reflection did the students attend? Explain.</p>
	<p class="question">Q3. Describe how the studnets worked together to perform their dance.</p>
	<p>Like you, these high school students had learned about both functions and geometric transformations. After doing the reflection dances they were asked: “is a reflection a function?” Here is one group’s response to that question.</p>

	<p class="question">Q4.Describe what you interpret to be their current understanding of reflection as a function. Use evidence from the video to support your claims.</p>
	<p class="question">Q5.Imagine this group is speaking directly to you. How do you respond? Why?</p>
	<p><b>Construct Reflect Functions.</b> After experiencing the reflection dances, the students worked on some of the reflection family activities to dig deeper into the defining characteristics of the reflection family of functions. In this first video, Thando and Christopher are working on a similar version of the Construct Reflections activity.</p>

	<p class="question">Q6.What is something "smart" about Thando and Christopher's discussion of the reflection they constructed? Explain.</p>
	<p class="question">Q7.Describe in your own words what Thando and Christopher notice about functions and reflection when they change the line of reflection.</p>
	<p class="question">Q8. What question(s) would you like to ask Thando and/or Christopher to help you better understanding their thnking about functions and reflections? Why?</p>
	<p> As the pair continued to work on the Construct Reflections activity, they started to make conjectures and test them by dragging and attending to the traces. Watch their continued work. In this video, you will see the last minutes of their work on this activity.</p>

	<p class="question">Q9. Based on the evidence in the video, what do you think Thando and Christopher understand about the relationship between the independent and dependent variables of a reflection function?</p>
	<p class="question">Q10. Based on the evidence in the video, what important characteristics of reflections are Thando and Christopher aware and unaware of?<p></p>
	<p><b>Hit the Target.</b> After completing the Construct Reflections activity, Thando and Christopher moved on to the Hit the Target game in the arcade to further refine their understanding of the reflection family of functions.</p>
	<p class="question">Q11. Based on what you know of their work on the Constructing Reflections activity and your own experiences with the Hit the Target activity, what do you predict Thando and Christopher will do when deciding where to place their targets? Use evidence from the Construct Reflections videos above to justify your predictions.</p>
	<p>Now watch some of Thando and Christopher's engagement with the Hit the Target Activity.</p>

	<p class="question">Q12. What strategies are the students using when deciding where to place their target?</p>
	<p class="question">Q13. Describe what Thando and Christopher notice as they are working on the Hit the Target task.</p>
	<p class="question">Q14. Describe what you interpret to be Thando and Christopher's current understanding of reflection. Use evidence from the video to support your claims.</p>
	<p class="question">Q15. If you were standing nearby monitoring their work on the activity and encountered what you saw in the video above, how would you respond? Why?</p>
	<p class="question">Q16. Describe the roles each student took on as they engaged in the task. Explain the mathematical contributions each student made while collaborating on the activity.</p>
	<p class="question">Q17. Looking across all of the activities in this unit, as well as the samples of student work, in what ways might these types of activities assist students in thinking about geometric transformations? In thinking about functions?</p>
