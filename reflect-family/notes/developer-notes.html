Warm-Up
	<p>There's not yet a good warm-up. One possibility is a pool table with the challenged of figuring out how to hit the ball into a pocket using one rail, then using two rails. Another it figuring out how to make a miniature golf shot when there's an obstacle in front of the hole, and you have to hit the ball so it bounces off a wall and into the hole.</p>
	<p>Should points P and P' be traced? Should they be labeled using function notation, as p and r(p)?</p>
	
Reflect Dance A
	In the teacher notes, should we use the diagrams on pages 1 and 2 of reflect-danceA.gsp to show the dance patterns?<br>

Reflection Designs
	I started this sketch just by copying the pictures on the top of page 3 of the current worksheet, which asks students to arrange their sketch to match a certain domain along which the independent variable is animated with a given range by locating the correct mirror. This can be expanded to provide more variety, as in the Rotation Stars activity from the Rotate Family lesson.
	
Where Oh Where Can the Mirror Be?
	This idea from Daniel could take up the slack from dropping most of the first activity, which is currently too long and too direction-heavy.

Reflect Games
	We should discuss whether the structure of these games might be improved. On the good side, one of the students in Donovan's class today took a look at the tool provided on levels 4 and 5 and exclaimed, "Look! That's the perpendicular bisector!"
