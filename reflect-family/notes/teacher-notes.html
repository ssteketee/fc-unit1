Warm-up
	<p><em>Time: </em>(5 minutes)</p>
	<p><em>Tips: </em>This little game is intended to motivate and challenge students by presenting them with the somewhat mysterious relationship between points `P` and `P'`, and in the process encourage them to think about the covariation of the two variables. Don’t let this activity go any longer than 5 minutes, and tell students who haven’t yet succeeded not to worry—by the end of the lesson they’ll have learned the secrets behind this function family’s odd behavior.</p>

Reflect Dance 1
	<p><em>Time: </em>15–20 minutes</p>
	<p><em>Materials:</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li>A roll of masking tape or other colored tape that can be easily peeled up.</li>
		<li>For each pair, a printout of the <a href="./reflect-dance-paper.pdf">dance guide paper</a> </li>
		<li>For each pair, an elastic band about 2.2 meters (88 inches) long, marked in the center (optional)</li>
	</ul>

	<p><em>Tips:</em></p>
	<p>If you have an odd number of students, use one group of three, and ask the students to make up a third dance of their own so that each student has a chance to dance as both the independent and dependent dancer.</p>
	<p>Begin by having two volunteers demonstrate a simple reflect-dance step in front of the class. Don't be explicit about how the dependent dancer should move, but rather prompt students to figure out for themselves how they should dance to model what happens when they move in front of a mirror.</p>
	<p>After students finish dancing, make sure they draw the patterns they followed; committing their dances to paper helps them analyze how the reflect rule works.</p>
	<p>The dance patterns that students draw should be similar to the diagrams shown below. Accuracy is not critical, as long as the distances and angles are approximately as shown.</p>

	<p><em>Possible discussion questions:</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Why do the instructions tell the independent dancer to always look at the dependent dancer?</li>
		<li>Was it easier to dance the independent role or the dependent role? Why?</li>
		<li>Which directions (in degrees) were easiest to dance? Which were hardest?</li>
	</ul>
	
Interlude
	<p><em>Time: </em>(5 minutes)</p>
	<p><em>Tip: </em>This video comes after the first dance to avoid making students self-conscious in advance of their first dance.</p>

Trace the Fixed Points
	<p>The purpose of this activity is to reinforce the connection students have made between the fixed points of the reflect function and the mirror, and also to begin to get them thinking about the mathematical connection between the locations of the fixed points (i.e., the points on the mirror) and the independent and dependent variables. This understanding, that a point on the mirror is equally distant from the pre-image and the image, will help students to discover that the mirror is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining the pre-image and image. The second sketch, in which students use the property of a circle (that every point on the circle is equally distant from the center), will help prepare students to use the compass as a tool to construct equal distances.</p>

Construct
	<p><em>Time: </em>(15 minutes)</p>
	<p><em>Tip: </em>On page 1, both students of each pair should take a turn creating a design of their own, and each should submit either a drawing of the traces they made, or a screen capture. The directions suggest a drawing, because the act of drawing helps students <em>feel</em> what a reflection is like.</p>
	<p>Pages 2 and 3 are optional, and particularly useful for any pairs that accomplish two designs on page 1 before the rest of the class.</p>

Reflect Dance 2
	<p><em>Time: </em>20 minutes</p>
	<p><em>Materials:</em> Enough tape or rope for each team to use for two mirrors.</p>
	<p><em>Tips:</em> This dance is intended to be more creative and improvisational, so probably doesn't require the use of a protractor to make sure students’ paths are correctly coordinated.</p>
	<p>This dance also incorporates composition of reflections, though it’s best to delay introducing this terminology until a later lesson. Some students may realize that two reflections across perpendicular mirrors is equivalent to a rotation, but there’s similarly no need to point that out to the class at this time.</p>
	<p>Once they have three dancers involved, students are likely to be tempted to add a fourth dancer in the  quadrant that’s empty, and they will have to figure out who that dancer should follow. This process may provide an occasion for some interesting and revealing discussion.</p>
