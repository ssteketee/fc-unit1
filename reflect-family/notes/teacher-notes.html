Warm-up
	<p><em>Time: </em>(5 minutes)</p>
	<p><em>Tips: </em>This little game is intended to motivate and challenge students by presenting them with the somewhat mysterious relationship between points `P` and `P'`, and in the process encourage them to think about the covariation of the two variables. Don’t let this activity go any longer than 5 minutes, and tell students who haven’t yet succeeded not to worry—by the end of the lesson they’ll have learned the secrets behind this function family’s odd behavior.</p>

Reflect Dance 1
	<p><em>Time: </em>15–20 minutes</p>
	<p><em>Materials:</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li>A roll of masking tape or other colored tape that can be easily peeled up.</li>
		<li>For each pair, a printout of the <a href="./reflect-dance-paper.pdf">dance guide paper</a> </li>
		<li>For each pair, an elastic band about 2.2 meters (88 inches) long, marked in the center (optional)</li>
	</ul>

	<p><em>Tips:</em></p>
	<p>If you have an odd number of students, use one group of three, and ask the students to make up a third dance of their own so that each student has a chance to dance as both the independent and dependent dancer.</p>
	<p>Begin by having two volunteers demonstrate a simple reflect-dance step in front of the class. Don't be explicit about how the dependent dancer should move, but rather prompt students to figure out for themselves how they should dance to model what happens when they move in front of a mirror.</p>
	<p>After students finish dancing, make sure they draw the patterns they followed; committing their dances to paper helps them analyze how the reflect rule works.</p>
	<p>The dance patterns that students draw should be similar to the diagrams shown below. Accuracy is not critical, as long as the distances and angles are approximately as shown.</p>

	<p><em>Possible discussion questions:</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Why do the instructions tell the independent dancer to always look at the dependent dancer?</li>
		<li>Was it easier to dance the independent role or the dependent role? Why?</li>
		<li>Which directions (in degrees) were easiest to dance? Which were hardest?</li>
	</ul>

Construct
	<p><em>Time: </em>(15 minutes)</p>
	<p><em>Tip: </em>On page 1, both students of each pair should take a turn creating a design of their own, and each should submit either a drawing of the traces they made, or a screen capture. The directions suggest a drawing, because the act of drawing helps students <em>feel</em> what a reflection is like.</p>
	<p>Pages 2 and 3 are optional, and particularly useful for any pairs that accomplish two designs on page 1 before the rest of the class.</p>

Interlude
	<p><em>Time: </em>(5 minutes)</p>
	<p><em>Tip: </em>This video comes after the first construction activity, and is designed to connect their .</p>
  
Find the Rule
  <p>The title "Find the Rule" is intended to emphasize the fact that reflection is a function, and is based on a rule that relates the independent and dependent variables.</p>
  <p>When students reach the last three pages of the websketch, a Perpendicular Bisector tool appears. It's best not to draw too much attention to this new tool, but rather to let students experiment with it and observe what they make of it. It's fine if they decide to ignore it. They will meet it again in the next activity, in a different (unnamed) form, where it will become more important to efforts to succeeds at the higher levels of the games.</p>

Reflect Arcade
  <p>The Reflect Arcade games provide an opportunity for students to further develop a kinesthetic connection between their real-world understanding of reflection and their mathematical understanding of the concept.</p>
  <p>Note that levels 4 and 5 of each game, which require significantly greater accuracy, also contain a perpendicular-bisector artifact that students can use to achieve the required accuracy. These artifacts will be most useful if students themselves discover how to use them. It's best not to interfere with the discovery process by providing any information to students about how to use these artifacts, about why they are useful, or about their connection to perpendicular bisectors. While students are working, it can be useful to put open-ended questions to student pairs (for instance, “What did you notice about this object? What do you wonder?”). Such open-ended questions can also be useful in a closing class discussion, but even then it's best to emphasize what students themselves noticed and wondered, and to avoid providing a “teacher explanation.”</p>
  <p>(Students will explore the relationship between reflection and perpendicular bisectors in more detail in a subsequent lesson about reflection fixed points.)</p>
  <p><strong>Activity Objectives: </strong>By playing all of these games, students will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Given independent variable `x` and mirror `j,` locate `r_j(x).`</li>
    <li>Given dependent variable `r_j(x)` and mirror `j,` locate `x.`</li>
    <li>Given variables `x` and `r_j(x),` locate mirror `j.`</li>
    <li>Get better at all three games through practice.</li>
    <li>Develop a sense of what reflection “feels like.”</li>
    <li>If any object was missing (the independent variable, the dependent variable, or the mirror, figure out where the missing object is located.
    </li>
  </ul>

Reflect Dance 2
	<p><em>Time: </em>20 minutes</p>
	<p><em>Materials:</em> Enough tape or rope for each team to use for two mirrors.</p>
	<p><em>Tips:</em> This dance is intended to be more creative and improvisational, so probably doesn't require the use of a protractor to make sure students’ paths are correctly coordinated.</p>
	<p>This dance also incorporates composition of reflections, though it’s best to delay introducing this terminology until a later lesson. Some students may realize that two reflections across perpendicular mirrors is equivalent to a rotation, but there’s similarly no need to point that out to the class at this time.</p>
	<p>Once they have three dancers involved, students are likely to be tempted to add a fourth dancer in the  quadrant that’s empty, and they will have to figure out who that dancer should follow. This process may provide an occasion for some interesting and revealing discussion.</p>
  
Accomplishments
    <p>The questions in this section are designed to get students thinking about what they accomplished in the course of the lesson: both things they did that they hadn’t done before, and things they learned or understood that they hadn’t learned or understood earlier.</p>
    <p>This is preparation for a concluding class discussion for which the end product is a sense of accomplishment and pride for new things that they did, learned, or understood differently or more deeply.</p>
    <p style="padding-bottom:0; margin-bottom:0;font-weight: bolder;">Conducting the Discussion</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you’ve previewed responses to the questions, use what you found to call on some of the less talkative students to contribute their responses first.</li>
      <li>As students respond, record in a way visible to the entire class enough of their response to bring it to mind later.</li>
      <li>It’s fine for students to add details to a response, but discourage students from correcting each other, and if the details are significant add them to the notes as a separate response.</li>
      <li>Some responses may duplicate previous responses; remember how valuable it can be for a student to restate an idea in her own words. If the wording is sufficiently different, add the new response to the notes, and point out that it’s related to the earlier response.</li>
      <li>Below is a list of responses describing a variety of possible accomplishments. If some of these accomplishments don’t come up in discussion, it may be appropriate to ask a leading question to elicit a relevant response from students.</li>
      <li>If appropriate, you may want to point out the way in which this lessons activities move between the physical, the virtual, and the conceptual, perhaps even observing that you can use the concept of function to help you understand a wide variety of real-world phenomena.</li>
      <li>The class discussion should conclude with the big picture. Some big-picture formulations are shown below, but it’s best to generate the big-picture summary from the detailed responses students have already provided.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="padding-bottom:0; margin-bottom:0;font-weight: bolder;">The Details</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We used a physical reflect dance and a virtual reflect dance to figure out the relative speed and direction of the two variables.</li>
      <li>We constructed independent variable `x` and reflected it across a mirror to construct the dependent variable.</li>
      <li>We traced the variables to make interesting reflection patterns.</li>
      <li>We used function notation, such as `r_j(x),` to identify the dependent variable as “the reflected image, in mirror `j,` of independent variable `x.`”</li>
      <li>We identified fixed points of the function and described their relationship to the mirror.</li>
      <li>We described the relative motion of `x` and `r(x)` as `x` moved in different directions (parallel to the mirror, perpendicular to the mirror, and at other angles to the mirror).</li>
      <li>We restricted the independent variable to several different restricted domains.</li>
      <li>We adjusted a restricted domain and a function rule in order to create specific patterns, including shapes of letters.</li>
      <li>Given independent variable `x` and function rule `j.` we figured out where dependent variable `r_j(x)` must be located.</li>
      <li>Given dependent variable `r_j(x)` and function rule `j,` we figured out where independent variable `x` must be located.</li>
      <li>Given independent variable `x` and dependent variable `r_j(x),` we figured out where function rule `j` must be located.</li>
      <li>We experimented with combinations of reflect functions, and investigated what happens when we reflect `x` across mirror `j` and then across mirror `k.`</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="padding-bottom:0; margin-bottom:0;font-weight: bolder;">The Big Picture</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We constructed, observed, and manipulated reflect functions, and we figured out how this function family behaves.</li>
      <li>We connected real-world experiences (such as seeing a reflection in a mirror and doing a reflection dance) to virtual world experiences (such as creating reflection functions and controlling the independent or dependent variable).</li>
      <li>We connected both real and virtual experiences to the general mathematical concept of function and to the specific geometric behavior of reflect functions.</li>
    </ul>
