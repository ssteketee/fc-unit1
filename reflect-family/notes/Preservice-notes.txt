	<p class="center"><b>Reflect Dance</b><p>
	<p>Think about your experience doing the reflect dances.<p>
	<p class="question">Q1.What do yu anticipate high school students might dow when posed the same challenges? Explain.<p>
	<p class="center">[inserst video link to Reflection Dance 1 here]<p>
	<p class="question">Q2. To which aspects of reflection did the students attend? Explain.<p>
	<p class="question">Q3. Describe how the studnets worked together to perform their dance.<p>
	<p>Like you, these high school students had learned about both functions and geometric transformations. After doing the reflection dances they were asked: “is a reflection a function?” Here is one group’s response to that question.<p>
	<p class="center">[insert link to Is a reflection a function video here]<p>
	<p class="question">Q4.Describe what you interpret to be their current understanding of reflection as a function. Use evidence from the video to support your claims.<p>
	<p class="question">Q5.Imagine this group is speaking directly to you. How do you respond? Why?<p>
	<p class="center"><b>Construct Reflect Functions</b><p>
	<p>After experiencing the reflection dances, the students worked on some of the reflection family activities to dig deeper into the defining characteristics of the reflection family of functions. In this first video, Thando and Christopher are working on a similar version of the Construct Reflections activity.<p>

	<p class="question">Q6.What is something "smart" about Thando and Christopher's discussion of the relfection they constructed? Explain.<p>
	<p class="question">Q7.Describe in your own words what Thando and Christopher notice about functions and reflection when they change the line of reflection.<p>
	<p class="question">Q8. What question(s) would you like to ask Thando and/or Christopher to help you better understanding their thnking about functions and reflections? Why?<p>
