				<p>Work with a partner to perform two short reflect dances, moving as if there is a mirror between you. To locate the mirror, put a piece of tape on the floor, with <a href="./reflect-dance-pair.pdf" target="_blank">a dance guide paper</a> in the middle of the mirror like this:</p>
				<a href="./reflect-dance-pair.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="./reflect-dance-pair-img.png" style="width: 25rem; margin-left: 2rem;"></a>
				<p>For the first dance, flip a coin to identify one person as the independent dancer and the other as the dependent dancer. You will switch roles for the second dance.</p>
				<p><strong>Independent Dancer:</strong> Always look at your partner, and take steps according to the directions below. As you dance, you can do any other body movement that’s both safe and simple enough that your partner can mirror it. Start one step back from the middle of the mirror.</p>
				<p><strong>Dependent Dancer:</strong> Mirror your partner’s movements, staying exactly across the mirror from your partner and the same distance away from the mirror.</p>
				<strong>First Dance:</strong><br>
				<ul>
					<li>3 steps south</li>
					<li>6 steps west</li>
					<li>4 steps northeast</li>
					<li>3 steps southeast</li>
				</ul>
				<p>✏️ Draw a diagram to show the path that each of you followed.</p>
				<p>✏️ Describe the relative directions you moved in each part of the dance.</p>
				<strong>Second Dance:</strong> (after switching roles)<br>
				<p>Begin with the three-part dance routine below and finish by improvising your own dance pattern. If possible, ask a classmate to video your dance.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>3 steps southeast</li>
					<li>2 steps north</li>

			<p>By the end of this lesson, you were able to perform these actions and answer these questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You constructed independent variable `x` and reflected it across a mirror.</li>
				<li>You labeled the dependent variable using meaningful function notation.</li>
				<li>You dragged independent variable `x`, traced both variables, and described their relative motion.</li>
				<li>You moved the mirror to form and investigate a different member of the family.</li>
				<li>You restricted the domain of `x` to a polygon and described the resulting range.</li>
				<li>You identified fixed points of the function and described their relationship to the mirror.</li>
