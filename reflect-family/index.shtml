				<p>Work with a partner to perform two short reflect dances, moving as if there is a mirror between you. To locate the mirror, put a piece of tape on the floor, with <a href="./reflect-dance1.pdf" target="_blank">a dance guide paper</a> in the middle of the mirror like this:</p>
				<a href="./reflect-dance1.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="./reflect-dance1.png" style="width: 25rem; margin-left: 2rem;"></a>
				<p>For the first dance, flip a coin to identify one person as the independent dancer and the other as the dependent dancer. You will switch roles for the second dance.</p>
				<p><strong>Independent Dancer:</strong> Always look at your partner, and take steps according to the directions below. As you dance, you can do any other body movement that’s both safe and simple enough that your partner can mirror it. Start one step back from the middle of the mirror.</p>
				<p><strong>Dependent Dancer:</strong> Mirror your partner’s movements, staying exactly across the mirror from your partner and the same distance away from the mirror.</p>
				<ul><strong>First Dance:</strong>
					<li>3 steps south</li>
					<li>6 steps west</li>
					<li>4 steps northeast</li>
					<li>3 steps southeast</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="pencil">Draw a diagram to show the path that each of you followed.</p>
				<p class="pencil">Describe the relative directions you moved in each part of the dance.</p>
				<ul><strong>Second Dance:</strong> (after switching roles)<br>
				Begin with the three-part dance routine below and finish by improvising your own dance pattern. If possible, ask a classmate to video your dance.
					<li>3 steps southeast</li>
					<li>2 steps north</li>
					<li>3 steps southwest</li>
					<li>Improvise and record the rest of your dance routine</li>

				<p>In a group of four or five students, tape <a href="./reflect-dance2.pdf" target="_blank">a dance guide paper</a> on the classroom floor to mark two perpendicular mirrors. Invent a reflect-family dance that uses both mirrors.</p>
				<p>Dancer `x` is the independent variable and dancer `r_j(x)` is the reflected image, in mirror `j`, of `x`. Dancer `r_k(x)` is the reflected image in mirror `k` of `x`. Decide among yourselves how the fourth dancer should move. As you create and practice your dance, check to be sure the dancers are correctly positioned relative to the mirror.</p>
				<p>As you choreograph and practice your dance, take turns so everyone in the group has a chance to be the independent dancer. When you’re ready to perform your dance, ask someone from another group to video your group dance.</p>

				<p>Until now, you’ve mostly been the independent variable (the penguin): either you were free to move around the plane, or you could move along a restricted domain. But in this challenge, you are the dependent variable (the frog), and your challenge is to follow the function rule as the penguin moves around her restricted domain.</p>
				<p>To move correctly, you have to always be in the correct location across the mirror from the penguin. Fortunately you have a reflection segment to help you. When the penguin is in the center of the white circle, you are in the correct location for the function rule.</p>
				<p>The hard part comes when the penguin starts moving: because you’re the dependent variable, you have to move to keep the white circle centered on the independent variable.</p>
				<p>Before you start the game, practice moving the frog so the circle and cross-hairs move around the border of the polygon, because that's the path that the penguin will dance.</p>
				<p>When you’re ready to play, move the frog so the cross-hairs are over the penguin. Then press the Countdown button and get ready to move the frog. When the countdown ends and the independent variable starts moving, you have to move the dependent variable to always be the reflected image.</p>
				<p>Both the polygon and the trace will change color, from red to green, when you’re in the right place.</p>
