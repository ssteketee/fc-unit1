Get Started
	<p>Display the lesson page ahead of time, so that as students arrive they can go directly to the lesson page and begin the Warm-up.</p>
	<p>This Get Started section is for the teacher; it does not appear in the student view.</p>
	<p>This note gives the teacher an overview of the lesson,  and provides information relevant to launching it effectively.</p>
	<p>The Ⓙ button at the top right of the page is a link to the student lesson journal tewmplate. The teacher can either have each student click this link to download their copy of the journal, or can download and customize the journal template as she pleases and then provide students with a link to her modified journal.</p>
	<p>The “Toggle Print Format” button makes it easy for the teacher to print out a group of notes in order to have them handy while leading the lesson. Press this button to hides all of the activity content, and display only notes and activity headers. Then use thge Ⓣ (and Ⓟ) buttons to show the notes you want to print. The top banner and the colored background of the notes are hidden to simplify the resulting printout. </p>

Warm-up
	<p><b>Time:</b> ~10 min., including discussion</p>
	<p><b>Purpose:</b> This provocative challenge can provide a motivating start to the lesson. The behavior of the sketch will become easier for students to understand as a result of what they learn during the lesson.</p>
	<p>A count-down timer visible on the screen can promote students’ awareness of the time remaining. Set this to 5 minutes when class officially begins.</p>
	<p>It's also useful to display a reminder to students as to how to obtain their copy of the lesson journal template.</p>
	<p>When time runs out, give students an additional 1 or 2 minutes on the count-down timer to record in their journals what they noticed and what they wondered.</p>
	<p>Once students have recorded their observations, ask them to lower or close the lids of their laptops, or to turn their tablets upside down. Then call on several students, asking them what they noticed and what they wondered. Keep this discussion brief. This is a good opportunity to call on students who don't ordinarily raise their hands.</p>

Introduction
	<p><b>Time:</b> ~10 min.</p>
	<p><b>Purpose:</b> This activity gives students a relatively gentle introduction to the concepts and objectives involved in this lesson.</p>
	<p><b>Websketch:</b> The websketch for this activity may contain no tools at all, or may contain a small number of tools designed to introduce the fundamental mathematical elements of the lesson.</p>
	<p><b>Worksheet:</b> This and following activities may include a Worksheet bar that shows or hides a worksheet for this specific activity. The worksheet, if present, typically duplicates the lesson-journal prompts for this activity.</p>

Interlude
	<p><b>Time:</b> ~5 min. (Short discussion optional)</p>
	<p><b>Purpose:</b> This section, if present, contains a video, image, or other stimulus to encourage students think about their prior knowledge of the lesson topic or about how the lesson topic connects to other contexts. At the discretion of the teacher, an interlude activity can lead to a short class conversation.</p>
	
Core Activity 1
	<p><b>Time:</b> ~20 min.</p>
	<p><b>Purpose:</b> This activity gives students a deeper look into the mathematics of this lesson.</p>
	<p>This sample activity has two parts. In the first part students manipulate pre-constructed objects to observe, analyze, and wonder about their behavior. In the second part students first construct and then manipulate the mathematical objects.</p>
	<p>Note that sub-activities cannot have their own notes.</p>

Core Activity 2
	<p><b>Time:</b> ~20 min.</p>
	<p><b>Purpose:</b> In this activity students continue their deep exploration of the mathematics, consolidating and extending what they learned from the previous activity.</p>
	<p>This sample activity has two parts. In the first part students manipulate pre-constructed objects to observe, analyze, and wonder about their behavior. In the second part students first construct the mathematical objects and then manipulate them.</p>

Check Yourself
	<p><b>Time:</b> ~30 min. (Possibly homework)</p>
	<p><b>Purpose:</b> This section is intended to give students an opportunity for performance-based self-assessment.</p>
	<p>Depending on the form of this activity, students may be able to document their results by taking a screen capture and either pasting it into their lesson journal or emailing it to the teacher.</p>
	<p>You may want to ask students to submit, by email or otherwise, a screen capture of their best effort at each of the challenges. Point out to students that earlier levels can be done precisely and later levels require students to develop estimating skills. You might ask them to submit two screen captures, one at a level of precision aiming for 10 correct results out of 10 tries and one at a level of estimation aiming for 7 correct out of 10.</p>
	
Objectives
	<p>This table should be filled in to show where students enact each of the lesson objectives. (Each lesson activity is identified by a single word of its title.)</p>

			<th>Objective</th>
			<th>Enactment</th>
			<th>Assessment</th>

Wrap Up
	<p><b>Time:</b> 10 min.</p>
	<p>This note provides information relevant to a wrap-up class discussion and to concluding the lesson effectively.</p>
<h3>Wrap-up Discussion</h3>
	<p>Include suggestions here for the wrap-up class discussion.</p>
<h3>Assessment</h3>
	<p>The patterns on pages 1 through 5 challenge students to think creatively about how to construct designs with rotation symmetry, and at the same time require them to figure out the angle they must use for symmetries of order 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12.</p>
	<p>The hint videos are quite explicit and should help students figure out how to use the tools. At the same time, they leave a lot of the responsibility on the student, showing only the first step in creating a different design than the one shown in the sketch.</p>
