Get Started
	<p>This Get Started note is for the participant in a PD workshop or preservice course; it does not appear in the student view.</p>
	<p>This note contains information useful for participants in both in-service workshops and pre-service courses. It supplements the information contained in the teacher notes: The T notes provide direct and reasonably brief support for the teacher using this lesson with a secondary class, and these P notes address pedagogical and curricular questions related to the strategies and suggestions described in the T notes.</p>

Warm-up
	<p>Though these notes serve primarily as a place-holder, some elements (e.g., the list of questions for students during the warm-up) may be useful long-term.</p>
	<p>Ask students to begin the activity by solving this four-part puzzle. Encourage students to share strategies with each other, but only after a minute or two of effort.</p><p>Avoid giving away too much information, though a general hint may be useful encouragement. For instance, you might ask a student who’s frustrated, “What do you notice about how the ball moves when you move player <em>x</em>?”</p>
	<p>Once most of the class has at least one ball in the basket, call the class to attention, with laptop lids closed, and ask two or three students to demonstrate how they one ball or another into the net.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>With which player was it easiest to score? Why?</li>
		<li>Do a player and her ball ever come together in one place? If so, how can you find that place?</li>
		<li>If you drag a player in a straight line, what sort of path does her ball follow?</li>
		<li>When you got the ball close to the basket, how did you decide which way to move the mouse?</li>
		<li>Which function made it easiest to score? Which made it hardest?</li>
		<li>How can you tell the independent variable from the dependent variable?</li>
		<li>What do you notice about the relative motion of the two variables?</li>
		<li>Did these functions have any fixed points? If so, were they useful in finding a solution?</li>
		<li>What is differant about each of these four functions? What similar features (family resemblances) can you identify?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This is a good opportunity to ask students questions that will remind students of important features of functions, for example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How does this game remind you of functions?</li>
		<li>What did you notice about the relative speed of the independent and dependent variables?</li>
		<li>What did you notice about the relative direction of one of the players and her ball?</li>
		<li>If you compare two of the players and their balls, what was different about the relative motion and what was similar? (Similarities and differences)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Tell students that they'll begin this activity by constructing their own Rotate functions.</p>


Introduction
	<p>Arrange students in pairs, with each pair responsible for discussing with each other first, and then when appropriate comparing their work to the work of other nearby pairs.</p>
	<p>Have a student read the directions, and make sure students know how to display the worksheet (if you’re not using printed worksheets) and that they know how to play hint videos.</p>
	<p>For Q1 and Q2 you may want to have students email you screen captures showing their constructions and traces.</p>
	<p>Displaying a countdown timer (approximately 8 or 10 minutes) may help to keep students on track.</p>
	<p>Ask several students to identify one thing they noticed, or one thing they wondered, as they constructed their functions.</p>
	<p>Here are a couple of possible observations or questions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What three things are part of every function?</li>
		<li>How do these three things relate to the tools in this sketch?</li>
		<li>What do the two functions you constructed have in common? What distinguishes then from each other?</li>
	</ul>

Check Yourself
	<p>You may want to ask students to submit, by email or otherwise, a screen capture of their best effort at each of the challenges. Point out to students that earlier levels can be done precisely and later levels require students to develop estimating skills, you might ask them to submit two screen captures, one at a level of precision aiming for 10 correct results out of 10 tries and one at a level of estimation aiming for 7 </p>
